## Api Authentication [Laravel JWT]

### What is JSON Web Token?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519), and it represents a compact and self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Digital signature makes the data transmission via JWT trusted and verified. JWTs built upon the secret HMAC algorithm or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

### Why is JWT Required?

JWT is used for Authorization and information exchange between server and client. It authenticates the incoming request and provides an additional security layer to REST API, which is best for security purposes.

### How does JWT Work?
User information such as username and password is sent to the web-server using HTTP GET and POST requests. The web server identifies the user information and generates a JWT token and sends it back to the client. Client store that token into the session and also set it to the header. On the next HTTP call, that token is verified by the server, which returns the response to the client.

### JSON Web Token Structure

JSON Web Tokens contains three parts separated by dots (.) In its dense form.

## Install & Configure JWT Authentication Package

Execute the following command to install [tymon/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth), It is a third-party JWT package and allows user authentication using JSON Web Token in Laravel & Lumen securely.

`composer require tymon/jwt-auth`

Above command installed the jwt-auth package in the vendor folder, now we have to go to **config/app.php** file and include the laravel service provider inside the `providers` array.

Also include the **JWTAuth** and **JWTFactory** facades inside the `aliases` array.

````
'providers' => [
    ....
    ....
    Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider::class,
],
'aliases' => [
    ....
    'JWTAuth' => Tymon\JWTAuth\Facades\JWTAuth::class,
    'JWTFactory' => Tymon\JWTAuth\Facades\JWTFactory::class,
    ....
],
````

In the next step, we have to publish the packageâ€™s configuration, following command copy JWT Auth files from vendor folder to **config/jwt.php** file.

```` 
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"
````

For handling the token encryption, generate a secret key by executing the following command.
```` 
php artisan jwt:secret
````
We have successfully generated the JWT Secret key, and you can check this key inside the **.env** file.
```` 
JWT_SECRET=secret_jwt_string_key
````
